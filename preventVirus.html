                    <h2 class="section-heading">Cleaning up viruses</h2>
                    <p>We’ve talked plenty of viruses and how to prevent them, but what should you do in the worst case where you get infected? You’ve got a lot of options to 
                        help in such situations so let’s look at a few of them.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Safe Mode</h2>
                    <p>Using safe mode will often be the first step to any of these other options so let’s see what it’s about. Safe mode allows you to start your computer 
                        with a limited set of files. The computer will only use and load the files that are necessary for it’s functioning, so if you have a virus installed 
                        on your computer, as it’s not essential for your computer to work, it won’t be loaded. This way, if you have viruses installed, they won’t be able 
                        to do further damage while you’re in safe mode. To start the computer in safe mode, you'll want to boot up your computer while holding the SHIFT and F8 keys
                        on your keyboard while Windows is starting. If you did it correctly, you should see the following screen:
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://techcult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/From-Startup-Settings-window-choose-the-functions-key-to-Enable-Safe-Mode.png"> 
                    <p> 
                        Safe mode usually comes with two main modes you'll want to use: with or without network. The main difference is that if you 
                        start safe mode with network, the drives for network will be loaded so you’ll have access to Internet and other networks. This is usually not recommended, 
                        as some viruses might have infected parts of your network driver as this is usually the first place where viruses enter your computer and as such your 
                        network drivers are usually compromised. But this is not always the case, as viruses that infect your computer don’t always infiltrate themselves through 
                        your network, like when downloading then executing a malicious file for example. It’s then very important to try and diagnose how you may have obtained the virus, 
                        but if you want to be safe, starting without network is usually a safe bet.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Backing up your files</h2>

                    <p>Viruses will latch themselves on certain files in your computer and corrupt them to use them to for their own purposes. But these files at some point where 
                        perfectly fine. The main goal of backing up your files is to keep a history of your computer’s files so that you may replace the files with a backup that 
                        you know is not infected and works fine. Windows even has built-in support for backing up files but other softwares can also provide this service
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://trinity-core.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/techjury/assets/620e66502e73d.png">
                    <p>
                        Of course, the main issue is that it can often be difficult to verify which files need replacement as computers 
                        have tens of hundreds of thousands of files. So, backups, to make sure that all the files that need replacing get replaced, will usually abandon all the 
                        current files and revert back to the backup. This will lead to data loss as all data that was made after the virus infected your computer will not be available 
                        in a backup, unless you manually select certain files to save and reimport to a previous backup but even then this is usually not recommended since these files 
                        that you bring back could also be infected and spread to the backup which would then require you to reimport again which is usually a time consuming task since 
                        backups can be very big as they save all the data on your computer. As such, the recommend practice is to make frequent backups, so that if you need to revert 
                        to a previous state, you can avoid huge data losses. The recommend frequency would be every 2-3 weeks. It’s also important to not overdo backups, because like 
                        previously said they are quite heavy, so you won’t usually be able to save too many simultaneous backups. So by spacing them out, you can keep less backups and 
                        insure that all the backups are different enough to track things that may have happened in a 3 week span that could be the origin of the virus which will 
                        help diagnose it.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Scan the system</h2>
                    <p>You can also attempt to heal your system by scanning for all traces of the virus and cleansing them. To do this, you can use many antivirus software or there’s 
                        also the free Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool that can perform scans and will be kept updated with Windows update. Multiple kinds of scans 
                        can be done. 
                    </p>
                        <img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/microsoft-windows-malicious-software-removal-tool-quick-full-scan.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1">
                    <p>
                        You could for instance scan only certain files you suspect might be infected with malware. But obviously, this kind of scan isn’t the best, as 
                        you may miss other files that could’ve been infected. Then there’s scans and full scans. A normal scan can usually be done while the computer is on and doing 
                        other operations, as such you can do the scan while doing other things. These kinds of scan can be useful, but they’re usually not recommended over their more 
                        complete brethren. Full scans won’t be done immediately, you’ll usually schedule a full scan to be done when you restart your computer. By doing it this way, 
                        the scan will be run as you start the computer which allows the antivirus software to prevent other files that could be malicious to interfere with the scan, 
                        and it will also be able to analyze components of your computer that couldn’t be scanned with a normal scan since they were actively getting used. This does 
                        also mean though that a full scan prevents you from using your computer for the duration of the operation which can take multiple hours depending on the 
                        quantity of files on your device. After a scan is done, you’ll then be presented with a list of offending files and options to deal with them. 
                    </p>
                        <img src="https://support.kaspersky.com/us/images/8515_0188-258942.png">
                    <p>
                        These will 
                        usually be to either quarantine, destroy or fix the file. Quarantining the file will put it somewhere on you hard drive that won’t actively be loaded, thus 
                        preventing it from accessing other parts of your computer so it can’t spread. This is a good option if the file that was infected is important and you’d 
                        want to keep it, but it will require further attention before it can be opened. Otherwise, destroying a file is always a safe bet to stop the virus but 
                        obviously this does mean the file will be permanently lost. Fixing the file is the only option you should probably almost never use, since fixing the 
                        file will rarely work and you’ll still have a high chance of keeping parts of the infection on your computer.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reinstalling your operating system</h2>
                    <p>If all else fails, you can always reinstall from scratch. This operation will usually require an installation medium of Windows, whether that be a disk 
                        or USB. Starting your computer with one of these plugged in your computer will open a Windows menu where you’ll then have the option to wipe your computer 
                        and reinstall a fresh copy of Windows. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_59418f2cd63ac.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1">
                    <p>                         
                        Obviously, the previous options should be tried before doing this, but if you don’t have any other avenues, you 
                        shouldn’t compromise your security by keeping a computer with a virus in it.
                    </p>
