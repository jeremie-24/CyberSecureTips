                    <h2 class="section-heading">Importance of Data and Tools</h2>
                    <p>Technology is taking a bigger place in our lives everyday. Whether it’s your work computer with company bills or your phone with client contacts, 
                        it’s clear to see that we’re often dependant on our tools, but what happens when someone weaponizes that need? Enter the world of ransomware.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How Ransomware Works</h2>
                    <p>Ransomware is malware that takes all your files and encrypts to render them all unreadable. Basically, locking away your access to all your data. 
                        The hacker responsible of the malware will then offer to decrypt your data back but for a price. It can also be noted that a lot of these ransomwares 
                        will try to claim that the lock placed on your files is “placed by law enforcement has they found illegal files on your device” and try to hide the 
                        ransom as a fine but the principle remains the same. Hence why it’s called ransomware: your data is held hostage and will only be released if you accept 
                        to pay the ransom. Similarly, to ransomware, there’s also leakware or doxware, in which the attacker will threaten to release sensitive data to the public 
                        if the target refuses to comply with the ransom. These ransoms will often be paid in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies because unlike typical currency, 
                        they are very hard to trace. This makes finding the hackers responsible for these attacks very hard.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Protecting Yourself from Ransomware</h2>

                    <p>Once you are infected with one of these malwares, there really isn’t much you can do, so it’s important to take precautions so that you can prevent the 
                        infection or give yourself an out if you get infected. Like most other malware, it’s important to watch out what files you download, which links you click 
                        and if your connection is protected. Ransomware is also frequently spread by email so being careful of which mails you trust is very important (to see more 
                        tips about email scams, see our <a href="emailFraud.html">Email Fraud</a> article). As for protecting yourself, an antivirus can be a great boon to prevent ransomware from spreading in 
                        your system. Keeping your devices up to date can also help, as vulnerabilities can be present in older versions of the devices you use which attackers 
                        can exploit to inject their malware. Finally, keeping backups of your files can help in the worst-case scenario that your files get locked away. That way, 
                        you can mitigate the damage that losing all your files can cause by reverting to an older backup, so that you can lose only one month worth of files instead 
                        of years worth.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Ransomware and Scareware</h2>
                    <p>As a last very important note, if you happen to become infected, it can be very important to verify you are dealing with ransomware. Some attackers will use 
                        the fear that losing all your data can cause to pressure users to act quickly without thinking too much. This is what is called scareware. So, if push comes 
                        to shove and you can’t afford to lose the amount of data you would lose, it’s important to first verify if your data is really encrypted. Try opening some 
                        files from everywhere around your computer, if you can open them all without issue then there’s no encryption and the attacker was just trying to scare you 
                        into paying their ransom.
                    </p>
