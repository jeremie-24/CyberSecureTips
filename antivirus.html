                    <h2 class="section-heading"> How does antivirus work? </h2>
                    <p>

                        Antivirus software begins operating by checking your computer programs and files against a
                        database
                        of known types of malware. Since new viruses are constantly created and distributed by hackers,
                        it
                        will also scan computers for the possibility of new or unknown type of malware threats.

                        Typically, most programs will use three different detection devices: specific detection, which
                        identifies known malware; generic detection, which looks for known parts or types of malware or
                        patterns that are related by a common codebase; and heuristic detection, which scans for unknown
                        viruses by identifying known suspicious file structures. When the program finds a file that
                        contains
                        a virus, it will usually quarantine it and/or mark it for deletion, making it inaccessible and
                        removing the risk to your device.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Several types of antivirus programs have evolved over the years. When setting up your umbrella
                        of protection, it’s important to understand the more common antivirus programs available.
                    </p>





                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Malware signature antivirus </h2>
                    <p>

                        Malware, or malicious software, installs viruses and spyware on your computer or device without
                        your knowledge. Malware can steal your login information, use your computer to send spam, crash
                        your computer system, and essentially give cybercriminals access to your devices and the
                        information stored on them, and even the ability to monitor and control your online activity.

                        Malware signature antivirus software detects malware signatures, which are digital fingerprints
                        of malicious software. Antivirus protection can scan for specific malicious codes, identify
                        specific viruses, and disable these programs.

                        While malware signature antivirus protection is key for detecting and eradicating known viruses,
                        one limitation is its inability to address new viruses. The antivirus product simply doesn’t
                        contain these new virus signatures.

                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"> System monitoring antivirus </h2>
                    <p>
                        This is where system monitoring antivirus software comes into play. This antivirus protection
                        can monitor software and computer systems for behavior that is suspect or atypical of the user.

                        For instance, alerts are created when a user connects to unfamiliar sites or attempts to access
                        a large number of files, or when there’s a significant increase in data usage.

                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Machine learning antivirus </h2>
                    <p>
                        Another form of protection can be machine learning techniques, which monitor “normal” computer
                        or network behaviors. The machine learning antivirus software is able to limit activities by
                        programs or computers if they look suspicious.

                        More specifically, machine learning detection implements algorithms to facilitate malware
                        detection that is broader in scope. This type of antivirus protection is beneficial because it
                        works in tandem with other antivirus applications to provide multiple layers of protection.

                        One example of machine learning is the design of Microsoft’s latest antivirus software, which
                        can gather data from more than 400 million computers running on Windows 10 to discover new
                        malware. (Note: To be clear, this is diagnostic data that a consumer can opt out of reporting.)
                        This, in turn, takes us back to the importance of signatures, as this intelligence will allow
                        for the development of new signatures for the latest malware discovered. This automation is key
                        in its ability to stay on top of the latest viruses.
                    </p>
