                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Toxicity </h2>
                    <p>

                        Internet usage is increasingly frequent and embedded in our lives. Therefore, it is only
                        inevitable that we encounter toxic themes during our browsing sessions. Other than hackers,
                        viruses and other complicated threats in the world wide web, there are also other dangers such
                        as propaganda, cyberbullying, and radicalization.

                        Especially for the younger population, people tend to use the internet to escape from the
                        everyday stresses of the real world. These people are often more vulnerable, and even targeted
                        by radicalizers. It is important to identify the sources of radicalization to prevent its
                        influence on us.

                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Algorithmic radicalizations</h2>
                    <p>

                        Algorithmic radicalization (or radicalization pipeline) is the concept that algorithms on
                        popular social media sites such as YouTube and Facebook drive users toward progressively more
                        extreme content over time, leading to them developing radicalized extremist political views.
                        Algorithms record user interactions, from likes/dislikes to amount of time spent on posts, to
                        generate endless media aimed to keep users engaged. Through echo chamber channels, the consumer
                        is driven to be more polarized through preferences in media and self-confirmation.

                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Targeted Radicalizations </h2>
                    <p>

                        Radicalisers are very good at identifying people’s anxieties and exploiting their vulnerability.
                        They will offer them a new narrative or a way out from how they are feeling.

                        Once the person at risk of being drawn into extremism is invited into a closed group, then the
                        group chat acts like an echo chamber. This is when the opinions or narratives expressed are not
                        challenged, but are being reinforced by the group.

                        This can make it hard for the person to consider any opposing views and can lead them to become
                        more extreme.

                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Toxicity in the gaming community
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The extent of the toxicity within the gaming world was brought to light with ‘Gamergate’ back in
                        2014, when a number of female gamers came forward about how they were being subjected to a
                        prolonged campaign of harassment, bullying, and even death threats from other online users.

                        Dissociative anonymity within the gaming community is a huge contributing factor to online
                        toxicity.

                        Negative energy and toxicity in general can be lethal if we are surrounded in it. This is why it
                        is recommended to take breaks to avoid being burnt out.
