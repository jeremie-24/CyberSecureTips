                    <h2 class="section-heading">What's a password manager?</h2>
                    <p>Password managers are a good tool to increase the security of your accounts and your online presence, but what do they do? 
                        Basically, the main use of a password manager is to store your passwords in a secure way as to not forget them. You can then 
                        use it to login instead of typing your passwords from memory.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">More long, complex, and unique passwords</h2>
                    <p>Thanks to the way they work, you can then rely on these to make your accounts much more secure. You can see our 
                        <a href="https://cybersecuretips.glitch.me/securePassword.html">article on secure passwords</a> for more details as to why and how, 
                        but in short, you can use such tools to make long, complex, and unique passwords for every account without having to remember them all 
                        which will be a major boon to your online security. Most managers will also provide password generation to make the process of making 
                        such passwords easier: for example, Google’s password manager can generate passwords automatically and store them for future use when 
                        you sign up to a website. If you’d rather still create your passwords, they can also suggest more secure patterns to help you create 
                        better passwords that are harder to guess.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Managing access to your accounts</h2>

                    <p>By using an application to login, it will also be able to manage and report all uses of your password, so if say someone 
                        were to use your password and use your account without your accord, you could be notified to it. You can also use it to 
                        store locations from which you wish to allow access, so you could for instance allow your at home computer and your office 
                        computer but block other devices from connecting to your accounts. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Keeping track of all your passwords</h2>
                    <p>Password managers make storing your passwords much more secure than say just storing them in a text file or on post-it notes. 
                        You won’t have to flip through that notebook that may or may not have that password that you thought you had in there but 
                        maybe not: it’ll all be organized for you: by <a class="glossaryLink" href="glossary.html#website" id="website">website</a>, by application, by date of creation, by last login… They can store 
                        them behind a password and encrypt them all so that they’re all easily ready to use which’ll also save you time and 
                        frustration. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Protection from theft</h2>
                    <p>The encryption that is used to store your passwords also means that if someone does manage to find them on your <a id="system" href="glossary.html#system">system</a>, 
                        they’ll just see a bunch of incoherent data that they won’t be able to use. In some weird way, you’ll also be more aware 
                        of phishing scams, since if you use your password manager with websites you trust, if someone tries to trick you into 
                        logging into an imposter website to steal your credentials (see <a href="emailFraud.html">Phishing</a>), your manager will not be tricked into logging 
                        in as it will recognize that this isn’t the trusted site you usually use. And in the off chance that your password gets 
                        compromised through some other mean, password managers also make changing your passwords very easy, as they can often 
                        automate the process of requesting and completing a password change for you.  </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">In conclusion</h2>
                    <p>All in all, password managers are great tools that you should definitely use. Like mentioned above, Google has a password 
                        manager available with their Google Chrome <a class="glossaryLink" href="glossary.html#webBrowser" id="webBrowser">web browser</a> that is available for free but investing into purchasing or paying a 
                        subscription for this kind of tool is very worth it if you care about your online security. </p>
