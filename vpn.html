                    <p>
                        VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network" and describes the opportunity to establish a protected
                        network connection when using public networks.
                        VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity.
                        This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The advantages of a VPN: </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Bypass Geo-locked Content</h3>

                            Many popular entertainment websites have different content accessible in specific regions.
                            This is done for many reasons, but the bottom line is that some content is only available in
                            a particular location.
                            By using a VPN to make your connection appear as if it is coming from the region where the
                            content is available, you can easily enjoy your favorite entertainment no matter where you
                            are.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Provide Safety Through Anonymity</h3>

                            When using a VPN, your network information appears as if it is coming from a location
                            different than your own. This disguise for network data helps keep VPN users safe, because
                            anyone looking to steal information would be getting the VPN server’s data instead. Using a
                            VPN keeps the user's location and other valuable information secure and inaccessible by
                            unwanted parties.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Secure Connection for Remote Work</h3>

                            Businesses today need to consider internet safety more than ever. With more people than ever
                            working from home, sensitive company and customer information is at a higher risk of theft.

                            For example, say an employee connects to a work computer remotely on a public network
                            without using a VPN. Theoretically, anyone on that public network could gain access to the
                            internal company network, because the employee did nothing to hide their information.

                            Unfettered access to company files and customer information can be catastrophic to a
                            business. Using a VPN to connect to business-based networks can help ensure that sensitive
                            data is hidden behind the dummy information provided via the VPN.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Save Money on Region-Based eCommerce</h3>

                            When shopping online, websites like hotels or airlines track customers' network information
                            to increase prices.

                            Some eCommerce vendors will even charge different prices for services based on region. Using
                            a VPN to hide your location allows you to see offers unaffected by shady pricing tactics
                            such as those mentioned above. The money you could save on flights alone could be more than
                            you spent on the VPN.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Cost-Effective Security</h3>

                            There are new "security solutions" every day, but the latest software and firewalls can be
                            expensive and may end up causing more issues than they prevent. You can avoid steep
                            licensing fees or monthly charges by using a VPN. While it might not scan for viruses or
                            block intruders from trying to connect to your PC, a VPN prevents the need for those
                            features by essentially making you invisible online. You do not need to block outside people
                            trying to get into your network when they think your system is two thousand miles away in
                            Jamaica.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Gaming Pros</h3>

                            If you have the bandwidth, using a VPN while gaming can have some advantages. The bonuses
                            include protection from <a class="glossaryLink" href="glossary.html#ddos" id="ddos">DDoS</a> attacks or angry players trying to gain access to your home
                            network. The region-free capabilities of using a VPN also means that you could choose which
                            servers to use when playing a game, which could even improve your connection speeds in some
                            situations. Some gaming titles may only be available in specific regions, and a VPN could
                            give you access to those games as well.

                        <li>
                            Using a VPN on mobile increases data usage

                        <li>

                            It won’t protect you from malware or phishing attacks

                        <li>
                            Most VPNs fail to bypass censorship & streaming blocks

                        <li>
                            A lot of VPNs are outright dangerous to use
                        </li>
                    </ul>
