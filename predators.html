                    <p>
                        Predators have been known to (although not exclusively) target socially awkward or shy kids and
                        convince them to keep the online relationship secret. The predator may ask for a risqué or
                        explicit photo that they may later use to bully or manipulate the child or share within predator
                        circles on the dark web. If the child refuses to send more photos when asked, a predator may
                        threaten to share photos they already have with the child’s family and friends. Often the
                        predator may ask the child to meet in person. These relationships can be brief or go on.
                        Regardless of duration, each encounter can have a harmful psychological impact on a child. Of
                        course, the worst-case predator situations can result in trafficking or death


                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Grooming</h2>
                    <p>

                        Predators are calculating. Online predators do not think the way you think or act the
                        way you act. Their motives and minds work on a drastically different cog. So understanding a
                        predator and teaching your family what to be on guard against takes learning about a whole other
                        breed of human. Predators view tracking down a child online as a type of cat and mouse game.
                        There’s triumph in the hunt for a predator. They invest a great deal of time—sometimes
                        months—trying to get a child to trust them online and share personal information. This process
                        is called grooming. While predators may be mentally disturbed, it does not mean they are stupid.
                        They figure out what is lacking in a child’s life emotionally and find any way possible to try
                        and fill those gaps. They use psychological ploys to gain trust and entry into the child’s
                        world. Then they strike when they believe they have a solid bridge of trust with a child.

                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Mirroring</h2>
                    <p>
                        Predators are devious. They can pick up on a child’s emotional hot buttons and begin
                        to “mirror” back those same emotions, which can create an instant bond of friendship or feeling
                        of shared pain or understanding. If a child is bored day after day, a predator can make simple
                        comments like “Tell me about it. There’s never anything to do here. My parents are always with
                        their friends.” Or if a child says, “I hate my mom she’s such a nag,” a predator can pose
                        empathy with a comment such as, “I can’t wait until I’m older and don’t have to put up with my
                        parents.”

                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Fishing </h2>
                    <p>
                        Fishing. Predators are shrewd. The term “fishing” in the predator realm is different from the
                        “catfishing” story we posted a few weeks ago. Fishing is when a predator “fishes” for personal
                        information from a child as a relationship is being built. This information can be about a
                        child’s family routine, sports activities, or their likes and dislikes. The more information a
                        predator can “fish” from a child, the more ways he can manipulate that information to gain trust
                        and access to the child. Predators “fish” by scanning social profiles, online conversations,
                        photos—and also by simply asking the child simple questions followed by more in-depth questions.
                        Because a predator’s mind is criminal in its thinking, a child can make an innocent comment
                        online such as “I can’t wait to go see Cinderella this weekend.” A predator can take that
                        snippet of information, do a quick search, and figure out which high school is showing a
                        production of Cinderella and—viola—the child has unwittingly divulged her location to the
                        predator.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How to keep your children at bay</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Have frequent and honest conversations with your child about the specific ways predators may try to befriend them online. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Be a safe haven. Discuss with your kids why it’s important for them to tell you right away if they feel uncomfortable with a conversation or if they are asked to engage in any inappropriate activity online. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Review your child’s online profiles often. This includes the content they post, who they follow, and the “friends” who comment or message them. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Inventory social networks and apps to ensure privacy settings are set to the most restrictive levels possible. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ask simple, critical questions: What apps do your use? What are you watching? Who are you talking to? 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Discuss the consequences of sharing inappropriate photos with anyone online. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Check-in with your child frequently throughout the day. If you work at home and get easily engrossed with work, consider setting a timer to remind you to monitor your child’s digital activity. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Consider parental controls designed to block risky sites, filter inappropriate content, and help parents set screen limits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create screen limits and a phone curfew to prevent late-night online conversations. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your child is attending class online, don’t assume they are safe. Monitor their web surfing activity through browser history and monitoring. Connect with teachers to inquire about safety protocols. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Seek out help and report it if your child encounters a threatening situation online
                        </li>
                    </ul>
