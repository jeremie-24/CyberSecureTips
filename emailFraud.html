                    <p>
                        In 2021, it was estimated that nearly 319.6 billion emails were sent and received daily. And in
                        December 2021, 45.37% of the total emails were deemed as spam emails.
                        <br>
                        Most of the time they come from a network of private computers infected with malicious software
                        and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge aka a <a class="glossaryLink" href="glossary.html#botnet" id="botnet">botnet</a>.
                    </p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading"> SPOOFING: </h2>
                    <p>
                        Email sent from someone pretending to be someone else is known as spoofing. Spoofing may take
                        place in a number of ways. Common to all of them is that the actual sender's name and the origin
                        of the message are concealed or masked from the recipient. Many instances of email fraud use at
                        least spoofing, and as most frauds are clearly criminal acts, criminals typically try to avoid
                        easy traceability.
                    </p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">FISHING: </h2>
                    <p>
                        Another term used to describe these unsolicited messages is “fishing”. When these spam emails
                        offer you the chance to click a link or insert your personal information, they are fishing
                        emails. Once you give them the information they want, the person behind the fishing scheme will
                        have access to that information and will use it how they please.
                    </p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading"> UNREALISTIC OFFERS: </h2>
                    <p>
                        When an email contains an offer that seems too good to be true, it is probably in fact too good
                        to be true.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Due to the widespread use of web bugs in email, simply opening an email can potentially alert
                        the sender that the address to which the email is sent is a valid address. This can also happen
                        when the mail is 'reported' as spam, in some cases: if the email is forwarded for inspection,
                        and
                        opened, the sender will be notified in the same way as if the addressee opened it.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How to not get scammed: </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Not responding to suspicious emails.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keeping one's email address as secret as possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using a spam filter.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Noticing spelling errors in the body of the "official looking" email.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ignoring unsolicited emails of all types and deleting them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Not clicking on links.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ignoring offers from unknown sources. The contents of an email are not a formal or binding
                            agreement.
                        </li>

                    </ul>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">A few common examples of email scams: </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A person without an heir, on the verge of death, has chosen you as heir to his entire
                            fortune.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A fallen official in a country at war has chosen you as a partner to secretly take money out
                            of his country.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some organization informs you that you have won an Internet lottery in which you have never
                            participated. Bill Gates is often presented as the organizer of the draw.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are offered a very lucrative job requiring only a few minutes of effort a day, paid for
                            by a foreign company.


                        </li>
                    </ul>
