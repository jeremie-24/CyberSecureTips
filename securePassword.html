                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why and how is a password secured?</h2>
                    <p>To remember you after you sign up, most websites will ask for at least two things: a username/email and a password. 
                        The only issue is that usernames and passwords are publicly visible to anyone, so the password is important 
                        because it’s private and (should be) only known by you. So, securing a password is protecting its privacy. 
                        To that end, most websites will encrypt your passwords when they store them, so that anyone can’t just look at a 
                        list of raw passwords ready for the taking. Most commonly, passwords will be encrypted with hashing. To learn more 
                        about hashing, you can view the following video:</p>
                    
                    <div class="video-container">
                        <iframe class="video" height="350px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/msE0z-GcE28">
                        </iframe>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">If passwords are securily stored, then why worry?</h2>
                    <p>Unfortunately, Internet security is always one crack away from getting exploited. Your password, as previously mentioned, 
                        is stored in the database of the website or any other program you signed up to. Sometimes, through cyberattacks, 
                        vulnerability exploitation or simply mistakes, these databases can leak. These leaks aren’t so rare: the website 
                        <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> catalogs most data breaches, and over 634 websites have 
                        had recorded breaches totalling almost 12 billion compromised accounts. And from these breaches, hackers can have access 
                        to lists full of encrypted passwords with the associated username or email.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">But these passwords are encrypted, so what's the issue?</h2>

                    <p>Thankfully for us, password encryption methods are more and more sophisticated and are very hard to easily crack. The 
                        encryption is usually so complex that no pattern can be found that could help reverse it and find the original password. 
                        But that doesn’t mean that they can’t be cracked. Weirdly, one of the most used methods is just guessing: instead of 
                        trying to find your password from the encryption, they’ll try to find the password that gives your encryption. This 
                        “guessing” is what is also called brute forcing. To learn more about brute forcing, you can view the video bellow:</p>

                    <div class="video-container">
                        <iframe class="video" height="350px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/msE0z-GcE28">
                        </iframe>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">So how can I protect my password?</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, it can be a very good idea to check websites like haveibeenpwned to see if your password is compromised anywhere 
                        or simply change passwords on a semi-frequent basis. Using many passwords is also a good idea, since at least, if one 
                        password gets compromised, it won’t mean all your accounts are compromised. Password complexity it also very important: 
                        long passwords, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters can make your password more secure. If a software also 
                        provides it, <a href="https://cybersecuretips.glitch.me/mfa.html">multi-factor authentification</a> can be a very 
                        good way to make your account more secure. By following these tips, you can make your accounts more secure but some of 
                        them can be hard to apply since having many, long, complex passwords can be hard to remember. You can read the section 
                        on password managers in our cybersecurity tools article to help with this issue.</p>
