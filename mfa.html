                    <p>Having a secure password is always important, but, even with a strong password, there is always a risk of being hacked. 
                        If your computer is hacked, the hacker could have access to all your passwords and accounts. 
                        That’s why adding security measures to protect your account is important. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a way to assure that the person connecting to the account is the true owner of the account. 
                        MFA requires multiple factors of authentication to verify your identity instead of a single username and password. </p>

                        <p>There are multiple factors of identification in MFA, and the most commons are something you know, something you have and something you are. For instance, a login could request your password (something you know) and a fingerprint (something you are). Usually, multi-factor authentication only requires two of those factors. That’s why this method of authentication is often called two-factor authentication (2FA) or two-step verification.</p>
                        
          

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How does it work?</h2>
                                      
                    <a href="https://www.avatier.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blog-mfa-how-it-works.jpg"><img class="img-fluid postImage" src="https://www.avatier.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blog-mfa-how-it-works.jpg"

                <span class="caption text-muted">avatier.com</span>
                    <p>When you activate two-factor authentication, you will need to do an extra step when you log in. First, you will be asked to input your username and password. Afterwards, you will be asked to prove your identity with your second factor of authentication. You could be asked to use your fingerprints with your phone, to copy a code received by SMS or to approve the access with another app. Most of the time, the second factor is only asked at the first connection with a new device. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Different Methods</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enter a code received by text or email in a short span of time.</li>
                        <li>Input an extra PIN.</li>
                        <li>Scan a fingerprint.</li>
                        <li>Use facial recognition.</li>
                        <li>Answer a security question like “what was the name of your first pet”.</li>
                        <li>Use a physical hardware like a USB stick that proves your identity.</li>
                        <li>Approve access with another app each time a request to connect is received.</li>
                        <li>Scan the QR code on the screen with a standalone authentication app.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Authentication Application</h2>
                    <p>Many mobile applications can be used as a second factor of authentication. For instance, some accounts could ask you to prove your identity with Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">When to use it</h2>
                    <p>Ideally, you should use it whenever it is available. Most importantly, you should use it for anything that has access to your personal information. Activating 2FA for banks, emails, schools, and online stores is an excellent idea.</p>

                    <p>MFA is extremely safe and it’s one of the best ways to secure your account. Unfortunately, a very small number of hackers have been able to bypass it. When this happens, it is mostly because the owner of the account allowed access to the cybercriminal with multi-factor authentication while thinking the access request was for him. Also, some people allow it because of confusion or annoyance. They don’t realize that it is a request made by someone else. </p>

                    <p>If you receive an MFA request when you didn’t ask for one, do not approve it. You should contact the platform hosting your account right away. Also, you should change your password on this platform. Furthermore, changing the password for any other account that uses the same one as the hacked password is urgent. The hacker could have access to all the other accounts with the same password. That’s why this website recommends using different passwords for every account.</p>

                    <p>The hacking of multi-factor authentication is a possibility, but the chances of it happening are extremely low. Don’t let that scare you of using it. You would be in more danger if you didn’t use it. MFA is an essential tool to protect your privacy. </p>
